## Learning JavaScript

In november 2024 I was still not sure which programming language to choose. I had done JavaScript before and after consultation with my neighbour Stefan, an experienced team lead in SaaS development, I decided to give it another try. 

This static webpage lets you select JavaScript method names and it will return a random example in which the method is being used. It is really nothing special. Stefan was very supportive, he did a code review and was happy to see pure JavaScript with dynamic elements. 

The thing I like is that you can very easily extend the website, just adding a .js file to the src folder starting with the name 'Formula' and adding an extra line in the index.html file is enough.

At the end I chose Java, not JavaScript, but I'm glad I have taken the time to create this. It helps me to understand better why so much of our current digital environment is relying on JavaScript and what the possibilities and impossibilities are of a statically typed language like Java. 

Furthermore this project got me updated on CSS, I used Flexbox for the first time which actually was a pleasure.
